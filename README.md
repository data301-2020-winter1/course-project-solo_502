## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

>Climate change is affecting our environments in unprecedented ways and changes are happening faster than ever. 
My research is trying to observe which of these changes can be measured and shown in western North America, notably at ski resorts, 
with the help of meteorological data dating back to 1901. For this analysis, 
I have chosen 2 locations for which I will thoroughly analysize the weather data of the past and projected climate trends in the future for now. 
The python code will then be used to organize and evaluate data for multiple other locations of ski resort in western North America.
I'm interested in what climate trends are observable with the given data for the last 120 years and 
which changes are projected to occur in the observed variables until the year 2085. This means that examined trends 
in the data must be found and subsequently tested on their statistical significance.
General trends in climate can be seen as a warming of the atmosphere, overall more, 
heavier precepitation events but also more frequent regional droughts. Climate change often presents itself 
as a shift in regional climates and I would like to see which of these changes are manifesting at the chosen locations in the region.
I expect to observe a decline in precipiation (snow) at coastal ski resorts in more recent times while continental 
ski resort will be less affected.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

>The dataset is provided by ClimateBC, a meteorological website managed by Dr. Wang of the University of British Columbia. 
The website provides the opportunity to generate and download historic meteorological data taken by weather stations 
for any location in British Columbia. The data is a yearly analysis between 1901 and 2019 of meteorological phenomena such as temperature, 
precipitation, evaporation, solar radiation and many more. It also provides highly detailed analysis for each year 
for the amount of days above a certain temperature, temperature extremes and precipitation for each season. 
Additionally, the data from ClimateBC provides estimates of all the above variables for the years 2025, 
2055 and 2085 under the official Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
I chose to analyze the mentioned data at two standpoints (to write the Python code for now): 
the top of Big White Mountain (2315m) in the Big White ski resort and on the Okanagan Campus of the University of British Columbia in Kelowna 
because of my personal interest in those two standpoints. I would be happy to observe typical changes in the two locations, 
but of course the conclusions of my analysis are limited by only investigating mentioned standpoints at this point in my project.
