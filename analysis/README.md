### The /analysis directory contains all jupyter notebook files used for the project.

The /scripts subdirectory includes the jupyter notebook project_function as well as the notebooks to visualize the data for each ski hill.


>The *analysis* directory contains the project function used to clean and wrangle the data as well as 
individual notebooks for each ski resort in the *scripts* subdirectory. In each notebook, the ski resort data gets
analyzed, cleaned and visualized using the same code. The resulting graphs are saved in the *images* directory.
Since I wrote the code while analyzing data for data from Whistler, the file **Whistler_analysis** contains very specific explanations,
comments and interpretations of my code and data. All the other notebooks are simply copies of said code that analyze the
data from a different locations. Hence the explanations are not quite as detailed in these notebooks.
